This metaphor refers to when hidden secrets or truths are revealed, similar to when the heads of yam tubers are uncovered.

  ""answer"": 1

The correct option is 1) Ìyá àgbà ò wọ bàtà tán. This means that the elderly mother did not wear shoes during her youth. In the metaphor, ""Ogún ọdún ni ìyá àgbà lò kọ́ tó wọ bàtà tán,"" the emphasis is on the absence of shoes worn by the elderly mother, implying that she did not have the opportunity or means to have shoes earlier in her life.",1,,0

Explanation: The metaphor in the start phrase ""Mi ò fojú sílẹ̀ fún un"" is comparing giving someone a sharp glance to someone turning their back and refusing to talk to you.

The option 'Mi ò fààyè àti yànmí lódì sílẹ̀' means 'I will not water and nurture you' which is the opposite of giving advice, so it is not the closest meaning.
