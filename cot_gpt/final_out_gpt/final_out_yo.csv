  ""explanation"": ""The color 'blue' is often associated with sadness or feeling down, hence the metaphor 'Ewé nàá pọ́n bí i òdòdó' can be interpreted as feeling down like the color blue. The option 'Ewé náà dúdú gan' translates to 'the black leaf' which doesn't convey the same",1,NG,0

} 

Explanation: The phrase ""Ewé nàá ti sunko"" translates to ""The leaf has withered."" In this context, ""Ewé náà pọ́n gan"" is the meaning closest to the metaphor, as it means ""The leaf has become dry."" Both phrases indicate a state of dryness or lack of vitality in the leaf.

  ""answer"": 0
}

Explanation: The metaphor ""Rónmú dún bí i àkukọ ní àárọ̀ yìí"" compares someone being silent to a chicken in a farm. The closest meaning to this metaphor is ""Rónmú pariwo ní àárọ̀ yìí"" which means ""being silent in a gathering"". The other option ""Rónmú se oúnjẹ"" means ""eating food"" which is not as closely related to the metaphor.",0,,0

} 

Explanation: The metaphor ""Rónmú ti lọ ra àkukọ lọ́ja ní àárọ̀ yìí"" translates to ""Going to buy a hen in the market in this situation."" This can be interpreted as ""Rónmú pariwo ní àárọ̀ yìí"" meaning ""Making noise in this situation,"" which is closer to the metaphorical meaning of the original phrase. Option 1, ""Rónmú se oúnjẹ"" meaning ""Buying food"" is not as closely related to the metaphor.",1,,0

Explanation: The metaphor ""Ojú ọbẹ̀ àti ẹ̀bà tí ó sè ń pe àwọn aràn inú mi"" compares two things that are mixed up or intertwined. The options are ""Mo fẹ́ jẹ ẹ̀bà àti ọbẹ"" which means ""I want to eat beans and yam"" and ""Ọbẹ̀ àti ẹ̀bà nàá korò"" which means ""The beans and yam are mixed together.""

In this metaphor, ""Ojú ọbẹ̀ àti ẹ̀bà tí ó sè rí bí i ẹrọ̀"" is comparing the relationship between ọbẹ̀ (soup) and ẹ̀bà (yam) to the way a conversation or discussion flows. The closest meaning is option 1) Ọbẹ̀ àti ẹ̀bà nàá korò, which translates to ""Soup and yam complement each other"". The idea is that in a conversation, different perspectives or points of view complement each other to create a complete",1,,1

In this metaphor, ""Ebi ti fẹ́ kó ìfun mi lé mi lọ́wọ́"" translates to ""The yam that wants to be difficult for me when I am hungry."" The options are:
0) Ebi ń pamí gidigan (The yam is very delicious)

  ""answer"": 1
}

Explanation: The metaphor ""Ajá Tifẹ́ gba bàtà lẹ́sẹ̀ mi, ẹ̀sẹ̀ mi ò balẹ̀"" compares Ajá Tifẹ́ to eating egungun (masquerade) which means that Ajá Tifẹ́ is deceptive or unreliable. Therefore, the closest meaning would be option 1) Ajá Tifẹ́ jẹ egungun.",1,,1

}

Explanation: The metaphor ""Mo fẹ́ràn láti ma bá ajá Tifẹ́ ṣerẹ́"" translates to ""I enjoy teasing the stubborn dog Tifẹ́"". In this context, it is comparing Tifẹ́ to a stubborn dog. Option 0) ""Ajá Tifẹ́ lé mi léré"" translates to ""Tifẹ́ the dog listens to me"". This option is closest in meaning to the metaphor as it reflects the idea of teasing or interacting with the dog Tifẹ́. Option 1) ""Ajá Tifẹ",0,,1

Explanation: The metaphor is comparing Lọ́ládé's speech to the sound of a drum. When a drum is hit hard (bí i igbá ọtí), it produces a loud and aggressive sound. Option 0) Lọ́ládé bínú sí ọ̀rọ̀ náà (Lọ́ládé spoke angrily) is closer in meaning to the metaphor because it reflects the intense and forceful nature of the speech compared to option 1) Lọ́ládé rẹ́rìn-ín sí ọ̀rọ̀ náa",0,,0

Explanation: The metaphor suggests that Lọ́ládé is delivering a harsh criticism to the students, similar to scolding or rebuking them. Option 1) ""Lọ́ládé rẹ́rìn-ín sí ọ̀rọ̀ náà"" closely aligns with this meaning, as it implies a stern or strict tone in the speech.",1,,0

  ""answer"": 1
}

Explanation: The metaphor ""Òjò ti rọ̀ sí orí àwọn irúgbìn oko náà"" translates to ""The day the heads of those yam tubers are uncovered."" This metaphor refers to when hidden secrets or truths are revealed, similar to when the heads of yam tubers are uncovered. Option 1) ""Awọn irúgbìn oko yìí ti sùn"" translates to ""Those yam tubers are asleep,"" which implies that the hidden truths or secrets are not currently active. This option aligns more closely with the metaphor, making it the correct answer.",1,,0

  ""answer"": 1
} 

In this metaphor, ""Àwọn ìbejì náà sun ẹ̀jẹ̀ nígbà tí bàbá àgbà kú"", the closest meaning is ""Àwọn ìbejì náà lọ sí ọjà"" which means ""the twins went to the marketplace"". This is because when a father dies, the children (twins in this case) usually have to go out and fend for themselves, which is symbolized by going to the marketplace. This option captures the essence of the metaphor better than the other option.",1,,1

  ""answer"": 1
} 

The correct option is 1) Ìyá àgbà ò wọ bàtà tán. This means that the elderly mother did not wear shoes during her youth. In the metaphor, ""Ogún ọdún ni ìyá àgbà lò kọ́ tó wọ bàtà tán,"" the emphasis is on the absence of shoes worn by the elderly mother, implying that she did not have the opportunity or means to have shoes earlier in her life.",1,,0

Explanation: The metaphor ""ìṣéjú kan ni ìyá àgbà lò láti fi wọ bàtà"" can be interpreted as the action of a wise elder shaping a young child (bàtà) or guiding them in the right direction. Option 0) Ìyá àgbà pẹ́ kọ́ tó wọ bàtà tán, closely aligns with this meaning as it signifies the elder's influence and guidance on the child.

  ""answer"": 1
}

Explanation: The metaphor ""Ó ti rẹ̀mí mo lè sùn fún ọdún mẹ́ta"" translates to ""I can sleep for three years"". The closest meaning is represented by option 1) ""Mo lè sùn fún wákàtí kan"" which translates to ""I can sleep for one hour"", as both options are referring to the ability to sleep for a specific period of time.",1,,0

Explanation: The metaphor likens the arrival of knowledge as silent like a thief in the night. Option 0 is the closest in meaning as it suggests that knowledge arrives quietly without making any noise, just like a thief in the night. Option 1, on the other hand, talks about a vigilant and cautious individual who enters with care, which does not align with the silent arrival implied in the metaphor.",0,,1

In this metaphor, ""Àlàmú fọ́ gbogbo ilẹ̀kùn ilé kó tó wọlé"" means ""A thief cannot enter a house whose doors are locked."" Option 1) ""Àlàmú gan ẹsẹ̀ mọ́lẹ̀ wọlé lánàá"" translates to ""A thief who cannot get into a house will not make noise.""

} 

Explanation: The metaphor ""Irun orí bàba Ṣẹ́gun jájẹ láàárín orí bí i irun orí báálẹ̀ agboolé Ṣétù"" is comparing the head of Ṣẹ́gun to the head of a royal ram.

}

Explanation: The metaphor in the question is comparing Bàba Ṣẹ́gun to a leader of a farm settlement. The correct option is ""Bàba Ṣẹ́gun pá lórí"" which means ""Bàba Ṣẹ́gun is the head."" This option closely aligns with the metaphor of being a leader in the farm settlement. Option 1, ""Irun orí bàba Ṣẹ́gun kún gan"" means ""Bàba Ṣẹ́gun's head is bowed down"", which does not fit the context of the metaphor.",0,,1

Explanation: The metaphor ""Ọ̀pọ̀lọpọ̀ àǹfàní ló ń kan ìlẹ̀kùn ilé rẹ"" translates to ""Many keys unlock the door to your house."" The closest meaning is that ""Àǹfàní rẹ̀ mẹ́hẹ"" (Your key is unique). This conveys that each person has their own unique path or solution.",1,,0

This implies that there have been multiple solutions or approaches that have led to success, similar to having many different keys to unlock a door. Option 1, ""Àǹfàní rẹ̀ mẹ́hẹ"", is the closest meaning as it suggests the presence of many keys. Option 0, ""Ó ní àǹfàní púpọ̀"", does not capture the emphasis",1,,1

In this context, ""Mo fẹ́ lọ yàgbẹ́"" which means ""I want to gather firewood"" is a closer meaning as the act of gathering firewood requires effort and dedication, similar to offering sacrifices. ""Mo fẹ́ lọ jẹun"" which means ""I want to eat"" does not align with the metaphor.",0,,1

In this metaphor, ""Àgbá òfìfo ni orí Ẹniọlá àti àwọn ọ̀rẹ́ rẹ̀"" translates to ""The head of Ẹniọlá and his friends is like a library."" The closest meaning to this metaphor is option 1) ""Ẹniọlá àti àwọn ọ̀rẹ́ rẹ̀ mọ ìwé gan"" which means ""Ẹniọlá and his friends know many books.""

Explanation: The metaphor ""Ojú abẹ́ Dérìnọlá ti gìn bí i kọ̀ǹga"" compares Dérìnọlá's eyes to a kọ̀ǹga, which is a singing bird. When a kọ̀ǹga sings, it is usually loud and full of passion. Therefore, the meaning closest to the metaphor is ""Ojú abẹ́ Dérìnọlá ti jìn gan,"" which means Dérìnọlá's eyes are bright and full of passion, just like the singing bird.",0,,0

Explanation: The metaphor ""Ìdòwù́ wararo"" can be interpreted as ""Ìdòwú dúró"" meaning ""tall tree"". In this context, ""wararo"" is more likely to be referring to the height of the tree rather than its color, so the closest meaning is ""Ìdòwú dúró"".",1,,1
